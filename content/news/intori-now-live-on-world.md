## We're live on World

intori is now available on World App.

This is a big moment for us. World gives us something rare: a network of real, verified humans. And intori is built exactly for that — helping real people discover each other through shared identity, not algorithms.

## What this means

When you open intori on World, you get the same experience we've always built toward: answer meaningful questions, collect stamps, find your circles, and meet people who actually share who you are.

The difference is that on World, every person you encounter has been verified as a real human. That changes the quality of discovery entirely.

> "We didn't build intori for bots or anonymous profiles. We built it for real people who want to connect with other real people. World makes that possible at scale."

## How to get started

Open intori directly in World App:

1. Open World App on your phone
2. Search for **intori** in the mini app directory
3. Answer your first daily theme
4. Start collecting stamps

intori is also available on **Base App** and **Farcaster** — your identity, circles, and stamps travel with you across all three.

## What's coming

We're just getting started. More to share soon.
