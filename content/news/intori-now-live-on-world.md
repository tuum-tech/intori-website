Today, intori is live on World.

If you are on the World App, [open intori now](https://world.org/mini-app?app_id=app_263f86463869627f1183badc977e21a3).

[World](https://world.org/) is building for a future where being human online actually matters. intori is built for that same future. We have spent months refining this experience specifically for World, quietly testing on Base App during that time, and building in the open on Farcaster for over a year before bringing it here.

The brains behind this project have been thinking about this idea for the better part of the past decade. How do real people find each other online without noise, without manipulation, without feeds that decide everything for you?

With World, that future feels real.

## Verified discovery with context and compatibility

intori on World is simple at its core. It is verified discovery with context and compatibility.

- Not a follower graph.
- Not a feed algorithm controlling what you see.
- Not engagement bait.

You answer questions. You collect stamps that represent what you are genuinely into. Through that, you discover other verified humans who share those interests. Discovery is based on shared signal, not noise.

## From discovery to conversation instantly

World recently introduced secure messaging inside the app with World Chat, powered by [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/). [Read the announcement here](https://world.org/blog/announcements/the-new-world-app-secure-chat-global-payments-and-mini-apps-for-everyone).

That changed everything.

Discovery only matters if it turns into real conversation.

With intori on World, you can:

- Find other verified humans based on shared interests
- See who is online right now
- Tap once and move directly into World Chat
- Know you are speaking to a real person

In a world where bots are always active, verified human presence actually means something again. When someone is online in intori, they are really there. Conversations can happen naturally. Not hours later. Not into a void.

> “Secure group chats are the social networks of the future. Especially when you can trust that no one can censor your conversations and your inbox is protected by technologies like Proof of Human.”  
> — Shane Mac, CEO & Co-Founder of XMTP Labs

## Built for this moment

We did not just wake up and decide to port an app.

We have been building this system for years.

We have tested across networks for months.

We have refined how matching works, how profiles feel, how status shows up.

We believe World is the right environment for this next chapter.

World verifies humans.

intori helps them find each other.

> “World is setting a new baseline for trust on the internet. intori makes that trust usable socially. We built this so verified humans can find each other with real context and start conversations that feel natural again.”  
> — Donald Bullers, Founder of intori

## Still available across networks

intori continues to live on [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz/?launchFrameUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.intori.co%2F) and [Base](https://base.app/app/https://frame.intori.co) apps as well. This is not about choosing one ecosystem. It is about building the best social discovery layer for real people wherever they are.

World simply gives verified humans a powerful new foundation.

> “Proof of personhood matters most when it unlocks real experiences. intori brings verified discovery to World and makes it easy for verified humans to find each other and start chatting instantly in World Chat.”  
> — Maria Gomez, Grants Lead at World Foundation

## What’s next

This is just the beginning.

intori’s core flywheel is simple. Answer questions, earn stamps, deepen your identity, discover better matches. Over time, stamps become more meaningful, collections deepen, and discovery gets richer.

We are building something that evolves with you.

If you are on World, open intori and start answering.

You might find someone who has been waiting to meet you.
